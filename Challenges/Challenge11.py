#For challenge 11,
#create a class called Sphere which takes a numeric value (could be either float or int) representing its radius when it 
#is declared.
#Sphere should have at least three methods:
#get_surface_area, which returns the surface area of the sphere
#get_volume, which returns the volume of the sphere
#set_radius, which changes the radius of the sphere (this should also result in new values being returned from the other 
#two methods).
#Feel free to set __init__ or other methods as necessary to accomplish this task. To ensure you match the test cases 
#exactly, use 3.14 as your approximation for π. The surface area of a sphere is 4*π*r^2; the volume of a sphere is 
#4/3*π*r^3.
