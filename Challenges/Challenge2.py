#Create a program that takes (at least) three command line arguments.  The first two will be integers; the third will 
#be a float.  
#On one line, separated by spaces, print the sum of the first two arguments, the product of the first and third arguments,
#the first argument modulo the second, and the integer quotient of the third by the first.
#Add 1 to all three arguments.
#On a new line, print the first argument bitwise right shift 3, the second argument divided by 2 (not integer division), 
#and the bitwise OR of the first and second arguments.  (all separated by spaces.)
#On the last line, print the sum of the first argument (after the addition) and the total number of arguments, 
#excluding the program name.
