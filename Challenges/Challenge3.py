#For this challenge, you will be given at least three command line arguments.  The first two will be integers; 
#the third will be a string.  Use what you have learned so far to create a program which accomplishes the following:
#Prints the larger of the two integers.  If they are equal, do not print either one.
#If the word "time" appears in the string, print the sum of the integers.
#If both the integers are odd, or one of them is a multiple of 3, print the string.
#If there are more than three command line arguments (excluding the filename), print the word "error".
