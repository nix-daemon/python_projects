#Create a function called factorial that takes one integer argument and calculates its factorial. A factorial is the 
#product of a whole number and all the positive whole numbers beneath it.  For example, 4 factorial (usually written 4!) 
#is 4x3x2x1 = 24.  The factorial function should print the factorial value.  It should not return a value.
