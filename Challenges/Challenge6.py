#In this challenge, create two functions:
#which_fibonacci receives a non-negative integer, which may or may not be a Fibonacci number. If it is, then it returns 
#its position in the sequence. For example, 2 is the 4th Fibonacci number. If 1 is given as the argument, the function 
#should return 2. If the argument is not a Fibonacci number, the function returns 0.
#next_fibonacci received a non-negative integer and returns the next largest Fibonacci number. If the argument is itself 
#Fibonacci number, it should return the next Fibonacci number, not the argument itself. If 1 is received, next_fibonacci 
#should return 2.
